## ðŸ“Œ Problems & Approaches

### 1. Find Square Root of a Number

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 1 â€“ Linear Search
- Start from `1` and go up until `i * i > n`.
- The last valid `i` is the floor of `sqrt(n)`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(âˆšn)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 2 â€“ Using `Math.sqrt()`
- Directly use Javaâ€™s built-in function `Math.sqrt(n)`.
- Returns a floating-point number, so take the floor if an integer result is required.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search
- Apply binary search on the range `[0, n]`.
- Compare `mid * mid` with `n`:
Â  - If `mid * mid == n`, return mid.
Â  - If `mid * mid < n`, `mid` could be the answer, store it and move `low = mid + 1`.
Â  - Else, `mid * mid > n`, move `high = mid - 1`.
- Keep track of the last valid `mid` as the floor of `sqrt(n)`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 2. Find the Nth Root of a Number `m`

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force
- Iterate from `1` to `m`. For each number `i`, check if `i^n` equals `m`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(m Ã— n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search with Helper Function
- Use binary search on `[1, m]` to guess the possible root.
- Helper function returns:
Â  - `0` if `mid^n == m`, `1` if `mid^n < m`, `2` if `mid^n > m`.
- Adjust binary search range based on helper. Avoids `Math.pow()` overflow.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(m) Ã— n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 6. Least Capacity to Ship Packages in D Days

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem Understanding
- You are given an array `weights[]`, where `weights[i]` is the weight of the i-th package.
- You need to ship all packages in **D days**. Each day, you load the ship with packages in order without breaking them.
- The capacity of the ship must be at least large enough to handle the heaviest item and at most the sum of all packages.
- **Goal:** Find the **minimum capacity** of the ship such that all packages can be shipped within `D` days.

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force â€“ Naive Search
- Try every capacity from the maximum single package weight to the sum of all package weights.
- For each capacity, check how many days are required using a helper function that simulates the shipping process.
- Return the first capacity for which the number of days required is â‰¤ D.
- **Time Complexity:** O((sum(weights) - max(weights)) Ã— N)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search on Answer
- Use binary search over the range `[max(weights), sum(weights)]`.
- For each mid capacity, simulate shipping:
Â  - If the required days â‰¤ `D`, try smaller capacities (move `high = mid - 1`).
Â  - Else, increase capacity (move `low = mid + 1`).
- Final `low` will be the least capacity required.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N Ã— log(sum(weights) - max(weights)))
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 7. Kth Missing Number

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 1 â€“ Using HashSet
- Insert all elements of the array into a `HashSet` for quick lookup.
- Iterate from `1` onwards and count missing numbers.
- When the count reaches `k`, return that number.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + k)
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 2 â€“ Iteration with Missing Count
- Use the property: missing numbers until index `i` = `arr[i] - (i + 1)`.
- Traverse array:
Â  - If `missingTill(i) >= k`, then answer lies before or at `i`.
Â  - Return `k + i` once reached.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search
- Observation: Number of missing elements before `arr[mid]` = `arr[mid] - (mid + 1)`.
- Use binary search:
Â  - If `missing >= k`, move left (`high = mid - 1`).
Â  - Else, move right (`low = mid + 1`).
- Final answer = `low + k`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log N)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 12. Median of Two Sorted Arrays of Different Size

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem Understanding
- Given two sorted arrays, $\mathbf{arr1}$ (size $n_1$) and $\mathbf{arr2}$ (size $n_2$).
- **Goal:** Find the **median** of the two sorted arrays when conceptually merged. The solution should be as time-efficient as possible.

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 1 â€“ Merging and Finding Median
- **Mechanism:** Explicitly merge $arr1$ and $arr2$ into a single, new sorted array, $ans$. Calculate the median from $ans$ based on the total length $n = n_1 + n_2$.
- **Median Calculation:** If $n$ is odd, it's $ans[n/2]$. If $n$ is even, it's $(ans[n/2 - 1] + ans[n/2]) / 2.0$.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(n_1 + n_2)$
- **Space Complexity:** $O(n_1 + n_2)$ (for the auxiliary merged array)

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 2 â€“ Finding Median Elements on the Fly
- **Mechanism:** Simulate the merge process using two pointers, but stop or record elements only when the total count reaches the indices required for the median (i.e., $n/2$ and $n/2 - 1$). This avoids creating the full merged array.
- **Median Calculation:** Same as Brute Force 1, but using the two recorded elements.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(n_1 + n_2)$ (still linear time)
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search on Partition (Optimal)
- **Mechanism:** Apply binary search on the **smaller array** ($\min(n_1, n_2)$) to find the optimal cut point ($\text{mid1}$). The corresponding cut point in the larger array ($\text{mid2}$) is calculated to ensure the left partition contains exactly $\lceil (n_1 + n_2) / 2 \rceil$ elements.
- **Condition:** The correct partition is found when $\mathbf{\max(L_1, L_2) \le \min(R_1, R_2)}$, where $L$ and $R$ are the maximum of the left and minimum of the right partitions, respectively.
- **Median Calculation:** If the partition is correct:
    * **Odd Total Length:** $\max(L_1, L_2)$.
    * **Even Total Length:** $(\max(L_1, L_2) + \min(R_1, R_2)) / 2.0$.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(\log(\min(n_1, n_2)))$
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
