## ðŸ“Œ Problems & Approaches

### 1. Find Square Root of a Number

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 1 â€“ Linear Search
- Start from `1` and go up until `i * i > n`.  
- The last valid `i` is the floor of `sqrt(n)`.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(âˆšn)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 2 â€“ Using `Math.sqrt()`
- Directly use Javaâ€™s built-in function `Math.sqrt(n)`.  
- Returns a floating-point number, so take the floor if an integer result is required.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search
- Apply binary search on the range `[0, n]`.  
- Compare `mid * mid` with `n`:  
  - If `mid * mid == n`, return mid.  
  - If `mid * mid < n`, `mid` could be the answer, store it and move `low = mid + 1`.  
  - Else, `mid * mid > n`, move `high = mid - 1`.  
- Keep track of the last valid `mid` as the floor of `sqrt(n)`.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 2. Find the Nth Root of a Number `m`

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force
- Iterate from `1` to `m`. For each number `i`, check if `i^n` equals `m`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(m Ã— n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search with Helper Function
- Use binary search on `[1, m]` to guess the possible root.  
- Helper function returns:
  - `0` if `mid^n == m`, `1` if `mid^n < m`, `2` if `mid^n > m`.
- Adjust binary search range based on helper. Avoids `Math.pow()` overflow.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(m) Ã— n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 3. Koko Eating Bananas

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem Understanding
- Given `piles` of bananas and `h` hours.  
- Koko eats at a speed `k` bananas/hour.  
- Each pile takes `ceil(pile / k)` hours to finish.  
- **Goal:** Find the **minimum `k`** such that Koko can eat all bananas in â‰¤ `h` hours.

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search on Answer
- Search space: speed `k` âˆˆ `[1, max(pile)]`.
- **Helper function:** Checks if Koko can finish within `h` hours.
- Binary search: decrease `high` if possible, increase `low` if too slow.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N Ã— log(maxPile))  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 4. Minimum Days to Make `m` Bouquets

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem Understanding
- Make `m` bouquets using `k` adjacent bloomed flowers.
- `bloomDay[i]` is the bloom day of flower `i`.
- **Goal:** Minimum number of days to make `m` bouquets.

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search on Answer
- Search days `[min(bloomDay), max(bloomDay)]`.
- **Helper:** `possible(day)` checks if `m` bouquets can be formed.
- Binary search: decrease `high` if possible, increase `low` if too early.
- **Pre-check:** If total flowers < `m * k`, return -1.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N Ã— log(maxDay - minDay))  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 5. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem Understanding
- Find the **smallest positive integer divisor `d`** such that the sum of `ceil(nums[i] / d)` â‰¤ threshold.

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search on Answer
- Search space: divisor âˆˆ `[1, max(nums)]`.
- **Helper:** `checkIf(divisor)` returns sum of divisions for given `divisor`.
- Binary search: decrease `high` if sum â‰¤ threshold, increase `low` if sum > threshold.
- **Time Complexity:** O(N Ã— log(max(nums)))  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 6. Least Capacity to Ship Packages in D Days

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem Understanding
- You are given an array `weights[]`, where `weights[i]` is the weight of the i-th package.  
- You need to ship all packages in **D days**. Each day, you load the ship with packages in order without breaking them.  
- The capacity of the ship must be at least large enough to handle the heaviest item and at most the sum of all packages.  
- **Goal:** Find the **minimum capacity** of the ship such that all packages can be shipped within `D` days.

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force
- Start testing possible capacities from `max(weights)` (minimum feasible capacity) to `sum(weights)` (upper bound).  
- For each capacity, check how many days are needed:
  - Keep adding package weights to the `load`.  
  - If adding exceeds capacity, increase `days` and start a new load.  
- The first capacity that allows shipping in â‰¤ `D` days is the answer.  
- **Time Complexity:** O((sum(weights) - max(weights)) Ã— N)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search on Answer
- Use binary search over the range `[max(weights), sum(weights)]`.  
- For each mid capacity, simulate shipping:
  - If the required days â‰¤ `D`, try smaller capacities (move `high = mid - 1`).  
  - Otherwise, increase capacity (move `low = mid + 1`).  
- Final `low` will be the least capacity required.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(N Ã— log(sum(weights) - max(weights)))  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 7. Kth Missing Number

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 1 â€“ Using HashSet
- Insert all elements of the array into a `HashSet` for quick lookup.  
- Iterate from `1` onwards and count missing numbers.  
- When the count reaches `k`, return that number.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + k)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)  

#### ðŸ”¹ Brute Force 2 â€“ Iteration with Missing Count
- Use the property: missing numbers until index `i` = `arr[i] - (i + 1)`.  
- Traverse array:  
  - If `missingTill(i) >= k`, then answer lies before or at `i`.  
  - Return `k + i` once reached.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

#### ðŸ”¹ Optimized â€“ Binary Search
- Observation: Number of missing elements before `arr[mid]` = `arr[mid] - (mid + 1)`.  
- Use binary search:  
  - If `missing >= k`, move left (`high = mid - 1`).  
  - Else, move right (`low = mid + 1`).  
- Final answer = `low + k`.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log N)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
