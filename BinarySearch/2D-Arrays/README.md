## üíª Problem SR-1: Search in a 2D Matrix

### üìú Problem Statement

You are given an $m \times n$ integer matrix `matrix` and an integer `target`.

The matrix has the following two properties:
1.  Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2.  The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

The goal is to write a function that returns `true` if `target` is in the matrix or `false` otherwise.

### üí° Approaches

We explore three different methods to solve this problem, ranging from the straightforward Brute Force to the most efficient Optimal Binary Search.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute Force Approach (Linear Search)

#### Intuition
The most straightforward method is to traverse every single element in the matrix and check if it matches the `target`.

#### Time Complexity
Let $m$ be the number of rows and $n$ be the number of columns.
$$O(m \cdot n)$$

#### Space Complexity
$$O(1)$$

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Row-wise Binary Search Approach (Better)

#### Intuition
Since each row is sorted, we can optimize the search. First, we identify the potential row where the `target` could exist by checking the row boundaries. Then, we perform a Binary Search only on that specific row.

#### Time Complexity
Let $m$ be the number of rows and $n$ be the number of columns.
$$O(m + \log n)$$

#### Space Complexity
$$O(1)$$

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Flattened Binary Search Approach (Optimal)

#### Intuition
The matrix's properties ensure it is equivalent to a single fully sorted 1D array of size $N = m \cdot n$. We can perform the most efficient search by executing one Binary Search over this conceptual array, mapping the 1D index back to 2D coordinates using integer division and modulo.

#### Time Complexity
Let $m$ be the number of rows and $n$ be the number of columns. Total elements $N = m \cdot n$.
$$O(\log(m \cdot n))$$

#### Space Complexity
$$O(1)$$

## üíª Problem SR-2: Search in a 2D Matrix II

### üìú Problem Statement

You are given an $m \times n$ integer matrix `matrix` and an integer `target`. The matrix has the following properties:
1. Each row is sorted in ascending order from left to right.
2. Each column is sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.

The goal is to write a function that returns `true` if `target` is in the matrix or `false` otherwise.

### üí° Approaches

We explore three different methods to solve this problem, improving step by step:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute Force Approach

#### Intuition
Check every element one by one until we either find the `target` or exhaust the matrix.

#### Time Complexity
$$O(m \cdot n)$$

#### Space Complexity
$$O(1)$$

**Code File:** `searchin2Dmatrix2brute.java`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Row-wise Binary Search Approach (Better)

#### Intuition
Since each row is sorted, perform a Binary Search in each row individually until we either find the `target` or finish scanning all rows.

#### Time Complexity
$$O(m \cdot \log n)$$

#### Space Complexity
$$O(1)$$

**Code File:** `searchin2Dmatrix2better.java`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal Staircase Search Approach

#### Intuition
Start from the **top-right corner** (or bottom-left).  
- If the current element equals the `target`, return `true`.  
- If the current element is greater, move left.  
- If it is smaller, move down.  
This way, we eliminate one row or column at every step.

#### Time Complexity
$$O(m + n)$$

#### Space Complexity
$$O(1)$$
