## ðŸ“Œ Problems

### 1. Implement Binary Search
- **Description:** Search for a target element in a sorted array.  
- **Approach 1:** Iterative Binary Search  
  - Maintains two pointers `low` and `high` and repeatedly checks the middle element.  
- **Approach 2:** Recursive Binary Search  
  - Divides the array recursively until the base case is reached.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - Iterative â†’ O(1)  
  - Recursive â†’ O(log n) (stack frames)  

### 2. Lower Bound
- **Description:** Find the first index `i` such that `arr[i] >= target`.  
- **Approach 1:** Linear Search (brute force).  
- **Approach 2:** Binary Search (optimized).  
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Linear â†’ O(n)  
  - Binary â†’ O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

### 3. Upper Bound
- **Description:** Find the first index `i` such that `arr[i] > target`.  
- **Approach:** Binary Search.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

### 4. Search Insert Position
- **Description:** Given a sorted array and a target, return the index if found. If not found, return the index where it would be inserted in sorted order.  
- **Approach:** Direct application of Lower Bound.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

### 5. Floor and Ceil in a Sorted Array
- **Description:**  
  - **Floor:** Largest element in the array less than or equal to the target.  
  - **Ceil:** Smallest element in the array greater than or equal to the target.  
- **Approach:** Binary Search with slight modification:  
  - Track potential `floor` and `ceil` values while searching.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
