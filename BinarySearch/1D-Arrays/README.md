# Step 4 : Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]

This section covers different problem types where Binary Search can be applied:

1. **Binary Search on 1D Arrays (13 problems)**
   - Classic binary search (iterative & recursive)
   - First/Last occurrence
   - Count occurrences
   - Search insert position
   - Rotation-based problems, etc.

2. **Binary Search on Search Space (14 problems)**
   - When answer lies in a range, not directly in array
   - Examples: Minimum days to make bouquets, Allocate books, Aggressive cows, etc.

3. **Binary Search on 2D Arrays (5 problems)**
   - Search in 2D matrix
   - Search in row/column-wise sorted matrix
   - Peak element in 2D arrays
