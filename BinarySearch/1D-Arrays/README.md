## ðŸ“Œ Problems

- [x] **Implement Binary Search**
  - **Approach 1:** Iterative  
    - Uses two pointers `low` and `high`.  
    - Time Complexity: O(log n)  
    - Space Complexity: O(1)  

  - **Approach 2:** Recursive  
    - Recursively divides the array until base case.  
    - Time Complexity: O(log n)  
    - Space Complexity: O(log n) (stack frames)
